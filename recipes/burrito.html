    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Stuffed to the brim with golden rice, creamy pinto beans, char-grilled marinated skirt steak, and the works, San Francisco's Mission burrito is a Cal-Mex classic. Can you eat a whole one? </p>
    <p>The mission burrito is well known for its comical size and heft, stuffed with things like grilled meat, rice, beans, and an array of condiments. Though it comes from San Francisco's Mission District, this taqueria burrito is now consumed all over the Bay Area and beyond via taqueria-inspired chain restaurants like Chipotle.</p>
